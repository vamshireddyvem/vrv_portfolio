                <p id="discription">With over six years of hands-on experience in full stack web development, I specialize in building dynamic, scalable applications that bridge elegant frontend design with robust backend architecture. My core expertise lies in React.js, Node.js, and TypeScript, complemented by deep knowledge of Redux for state management, Express for API development, and MongoDB for data modeling. I’ve led and contributed to enterprise-grade solutions across e-commerce, finance, and SaaS platforms, consistently aligning technical execution with business goals.
                Beyond coding, I bring a strong focus on UI/UX design, performance optimization, and cloud deployment strategies. I’ve implemented secure authentication flows, integrated RESTful and GraphQL APIs, and built responsive interfaces that adapt seamlessly across devices. My development workflow emphasizes clean architecture, reusable components, and rigorous testing using tools like Jest, Cypress, and React Testing Library. Whether collaborating with cross-functional teams or architecting end-to-end solutions, I strive to deliver maintainable, high-impact software that drives results.<p>
